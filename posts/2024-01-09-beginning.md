# First steps

I quit my job. Now I'm working for myself. Where to start? The blog, obviously. I don't know how long this journey will be, so I want to start out doing things right. That way, regardless of length, I will have something I can look back at with pride. Not here for a long time, not here for a good time, here for documentation and metadata.

## The Work

I need to finish the next update to Trellis. At Stanford, I was calling this Trellis version 1.3. Now that I've moved on, I think I'll call it Trellis 2. It is a major updateso I think a whole new version number is warranted; a major update for the software but also for myself. And for now, I am as free as I probably ever will be to work on it the way I see fit. I do not have other work obligations, I do not have the money to engage in extravagant fun, and I have a healthy dose of fear: fear of reaching the end of my financial means having not finished the work I set out to do.

## Landscape of Fear

I watched an episode of Nature on PBS where they focussed on keystone species; species whose presence is essential to maintaining the health of an ecosystem and whose removal causes devastation. They are usually apex predators and it is not necessarily that they eat all the grazers and stop them from decimating the flora, it is that their mere presence inspires fear that keeps the grazers moving. By reintroducing keystone species into an environment, they reinstitute "the landscape of fear", which sounds bad because we all think of fear as a negative thing, but it's good. Without fear we stop moving and gorge ourselves and destroy everything around us.

Humans do not have a predator to fear, we are a "hyper predator", so then where does the fear come from that keeps us moving? I suppose, in theory, God. But not enough people believe in a God and certainly not one worth fearing. No, we are mostly afraid of nothingness: that we will have nothing and nobody will help us. If only there were a vengeful God, an authority figure to instill fear in humanity that if we acted selfishly or cruelly we would meet appropriate retribution.

## Landscape of Accountability

But is that really what we aspire to? What was the value of all the evolutionary steps that allowed our brains to develop language and reason if we are just going to be goverened by the same primitive instincts as every other creature? I think we can do better. Fear is not fun and life should be fun. Instead of fear of retribution from some bigger predator let's aim for accountability; to design a system where the only people we need fear are our fellow people.

How can we achieve such accountability when the balance of power is skewed so heavily towards our elites? We need them to play by the same rules that the rest of us do, we need those rules to be hard coded, and we need all of the transactions to be transparent so that all of us have visibility into what everyone else is up to.

And if we all have absolute transparency into the lives of everyone else, we will live in a perfect surveillance state where nobody has any privacy. That would be worse. So, how do we maitain both: privacy and transparency? What is the one solution that will radically transform our society into a vision of heaven on Earth? 

## A Blind Metadata Broker

A blind metadata broker for transactions. Was that what you guessed? "Blind metadata broker"? It doesn't sound particularly sexy. Google Translate tells me that in French it could be "courtier aveugle en metadonnees", which still doesn't sound particularly appealing. Sometimes good solutions aren't sexy, sometimes they are so boring that nobody thinks about them and instead focusses on the things in life that are actually fun: making friends and eating cookies and making love and maybe some combination of the aforementioned. In fact, that sounds like the best kind of technology: so boring and effective as to be practically forgotten, so that we can focus on the real world.

## The Work (again)

Trellis is not a blind metadata broker, but it is a system for handling and manipulating metadata. And the ideas that underlie it can be the foundation for a transformative system for making transactions. That's the dream, my vision, the reason I quit my job. Now comes what I assume will be the practically trivial part of converting that vague idea into reality.
